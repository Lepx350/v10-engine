  Purpose-built for storyboard → cinematic image pipeline
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Consistency Layers:
    L1: Multi-angle character refs (front / 3/4 / action)
    L2: Environment refs (key locations)
    L3: World anchor (persistent rules in every prompt)
    L4: Multi-turn chat (grouped by section)
    L5: Post-processing (teal-orange grade + vignette + grain)
    L6: Master Shots (hero render per location, shared globally)
    L7: Visual Memory Bank (latest successful render per char/env,
        carried across sections so ABC stays ABC forever)

  Rules:
    • 1 character per panel (warn if 2+ detected)
    • Max 60 words per prompt (warn if exceeded)
    • Style prefix injected by tool, not in prompt
    • Media Video REMOVED — fully AI-generated pipeline
    • GFX removed in v3 — fully 3D pipeline (Noir + Fern only)
    • Cold Open: Noir only
